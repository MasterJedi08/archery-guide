<p>
It’s very important to know where you are going to buy your equipment from. 
You want to make sure they are reputable and that you are getting reliable, safe equipment.

Local Shop - We highly recommend that you purchase equipment from and through your local shop. Most archery shops will have some items available to purchase off the shelf, and most items will need to be ordered through them. Not only are you supporting a local business, but you can get expert advice on what you are trying to buy. 

Lancaster Archery Supply - This is THE online place to buy archery supplies. Hundreds of brands and every archery item you can imagine, Lancaster Archery Supply is where everyone gets anything archery. Also the best place to conduct research on what you want to buy!

Manufacturer Site - sometimes, items from manufacturers are not available on Lancaster Archery Supply. In this case, check out the manufacturer’s website to see if you can purchase directly from their site.

★ Note on Buying from Amazon - Amazon is not a reputable site to buy archery equipment from. Often the equipment found on Amazon is of low quality or is a toy kit not meant for real archery. We do not recommend buying your archery equipment from Amazon, and instead recommend the places above.
