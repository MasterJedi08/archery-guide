<h2 id="intro">Intro</h2>
Arrows are one of the most, if not THE most, important parts of your setup. An arrow can make or break your shots, so it's important to know what you're getting & why.
<br>
First, let's go over some definitions of arrow parts you'll see when looking at arrows:

<b>GRAIN</b> - The weight of the arrow shaft (point grain = weight of the point)

<b>NOCK</b> - This U-shaped piece of plastic on the back of the arrow is the part that connects the arrow to the string. Fun fact: you can get ones that glow or light up!

<b>POINT</b> - The pointy part. These can come in many shapes, with broadheads being a specific type used only for hunting.

<b>SHAFT</b> - The long part of the arrow, made of aluminum, wood, or carbon fiber.

<b>SPINE</b> - The flexibility/stiffness of the arrow. This is a big factor in determining the right arrows for you if you get personal equipment.

<b>VANES</b> - (AKA “Fletching”) 3 pieces of plastic, silicone, or feathers that are attached to the back portion of the arrow (towards the nock). These help the arrow stabilize in flight. Typically, one of the vanes will be a different color, which marks the correct orientation 
for nocking on the bowstring (orientation depends on bow type).
<br>
Now, let's get more in depth on the most important parts that will affect your arrow: material, spine, and vanes. For the other parts listed above, here's some quick info. The nocks will often be recommended by the manufacturer for what fits the arrow shaft best, and points/grain won't be 
much of an issue until you're at a highly competitive level. Main takeaway of points: the heavier the point, the faster the arrow will fall.
<br>

<h2 id="shaft">Arrow Shaft</h2>
The shaft is the longest part of the arrow, and the biggest factor in how the arrow flies. This is also the part that has the most variations, each affecting the arrow’s purpose and performance. These variations are material, spine, length, diameter, and weight.
<br>
<h4>Material</h4>
Materials can affect the arrow’s performance - there are three main types:
<ul>
<li>Wood arrows are less common to find. However, they’re the most brittle, being more likely to break, splinter, or warp than the others. They are most often seen in traditional archery. </li>
<li>Aluminum arrows are cheapest, and typically what "box arrows" are made of. These are a solid option as they are the most sturdy of the three, are widely available, and come in a large range of sizes. These are the best option for beginners & those on a budget. </li>
<li>Carbon arrows are the most expensive, but the highest performing. Intermediate to Advanced archers should be using this type of arrow. Their stiffness helps the accuracy of these, but if these break they need to 
be handled carefully and tossed immediately (carbon splinters are very small and very painful).</li>
</ul>
<br>

<h4>Length</h4>
Length of the arrow will be either pre-cut for box arrows or cut to your specifications. If you decide to cut your arrows, it will be determined by your draw length. When ordering 
arrows from a shop that will be cut for your measurements, they will have you draw an arrow, mark it at full draw, then cut it to a custom length based on your draw. 
<br>

<h4>Diameter</h4>
Diameter of the arrow is how thick the arrow is. The diameter of the arrow can affect the flight of the arrow, espcially outdoors, and will ultimately be lighter. “Line breakers” are thicker, larger diameter arrows and therefore more likely to break the 
line on the target, earning an extra point. Indoor target archers tend to go for thicker diameters for this reason. Outdoor archers opt for thinner arrows, as thinner arrows are less likely to be affected by the wind & can travel farther due to lighter weight.
<br>

<h4>Grain</h4>
Weight/Grain of an arrow is how much the arrow itself weighs. This will be measured in “grains per inch” which is why it’s often referred to as the “grain of an arrow.” The weight of the arrow you choose will be directly 
related to the draw weight of your bow. Usually, lighter bows use lighter arrows, and heavier bows need heavier arrows.


<h2 id="spine">Arrow Spine</h2>
Spine is what will truly determine if the arrow is right for you and your bow. Spine refers to the stiffness of the arrow - how much it will bend in the air. 
(If you watch slo-mo of an arrow’s flight, it doesn’t stay straight, it wiggles. The more stiff, the less wiggle). 

<h4>Why Does Spine Matter?</h4>
The spine of the arrow will determine how your arrow flies. An incorrect spine will make your arrow fly in an inconsistent pattern. 
<ul>
    <li><b>Too Stiff</b> - a spine that is too stiff, aka "over spined" will typically go left</li>
    <li><b>Too Soft</b> - a spine that is not stiff enough, aka "under spined" will typically go right</li>
</ul>
If you recently went up in draw weight and your arrows are going way right or left, check to make sure your spine is correct!

<h4>What Spine is Right for Me?</h4>
Spine measurements vary by material and manufacturer. 
<ul>
<li>Wood arrows have a 4 digit number, ex: 2025. The numbers refer to the range of draw weight the arrow should be used for. A 2025 arrow should be used for a draw weight between 20-25 lbs.</li>
<li>Aluminum arrows also use 4 digits, but the numbers do not refer to draw weight. Instead, the first two digits refer to the diameter of the arrow and the second two digits refer to 
the thickness of the arrow walls. For example, a 1916 aluminum arrow would be 19/64” diameter with walls that are 16/1000” thick. (format: xy spine is x/64" diameter, y/1000" walls).</li>
<li>Carbon arrows commonly use 3 digits - this number tells you how much a 28-inch spine arrow will bend when 2 pounds of force are pulling against it. For example, a carbon arrow rated at 300 would bend 0.300 inches. 
The larger the number, the more it bends. Lower numbers are better for heavier bows. Note - carbon arrows are measured differently per manufacturer, so double check their measuring system!</li>
</ul>

Thankfully, most manufacturer’s will have a chart to help you select your arrows. Easton’s chart is linked here: <a href=https://eastonarchery.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/301055-A-Arrow-Shaft-Selection-Target.pdf>Easton Spine Chart</a>. 
Their chart will use the arrow length & draw weight to determine the correct spine. Example: for an aluminum arrow that is 25” and a draw weight of 25lbs, you would want to get a spine of 1614.

Be sure to look up the manufacturer’s chart ahead of time before purchasing! Your local shop can also help with understanding what spine you need.

<h2 id="vanes">Vanes</h2>
The vanes, aka fletching, are the 3 plastic or feather pieces at the back end of the arrow. Most often, 2 will be one color and the 3rd will be a different color, called the “index vane.” Here are the types and versions of fletchings.
The purpose of vanes is to stabilize and steer the arrow while in flight. Therefore, the type, material, and style of vanes you decide to use will greatly impact your shot.

<h4>Material</h4>
Material of the vane will be determined by your bow type and shooting style
Feathers are most common for barebow/recurve (especially if you shoot with a shelf rest). The feathers will be more forgiving to the flight of the arrow, as it will easily bend out of the way if it hits the bow shelf. 
However, they can easily get wet or messed up. You can get real or faux (plastic) feathers.
Plastic vanes are very durable, but less forgiving if they hit the riser or bow shelf. These are great for indoors or outdoors.

<h4>Vane Types</h4>>
Starting out, stick with standard as that will be what is most available to you. The other versions are used in specific settings/high-level archery. 

<ul>
<li>Standard fletchings will be 3 vanes, straight on the shaft, with 2 vanes of one color and the 3rd vane being a separate color. These will either be a flat piece of plastic or plastic made to look like feathers.</li>
<li>Spin Wings are a specific type of fletching that is seen mainly in high level competitive Olympic Recurve. The helical, thin shape gives minimal drag and maximum spin to straighten out the arrow flight
    for the long outdoor distance of 70m.</li>
<li>Offset/Helical fletching are used in high level target and hunting compound. These vanes are not straight on the shaft, instead either being offset or in a helical pattern. These give greater spin of the shaft to straighten
    out the arrow in flight.</li>
<li>Flu Flu fletchings are large feathers designed to go long distances with accuracy, mainly used in traditional archery and hunting. </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="upgrade">Buying for your Skill Level & Upgrading</h2>
When buying arrows, you have two options: box or custom. 

<h4>Box Arrows</h4>
What: Box arrows are ready to go, pre-assembled arrows that are available in most shops. They are displayed in boxes, hence the name. These are typically alumnium, though there are some carbon options. 

Price Range: $6-12 per arrow

Who Should Buy: Beginners & those looking to stay on a budget. 

When to Upgrade: While box arrows are solid options, once you reach an intermediate level, custom arrows will give you a more tailored experience while shooting. Consistency is key, and custom arrows
tailored to your specifications will give a more consistent shot.

<h4>Custom Arrows</h4>
What: Custom arrows are made piece by piece, determined by you and/or the shop you purchase from. The exact length, spine, and vanes (+ vane color!) will be tailored to your setup.

Price Range: $15-$$$$$$+ per arrow

Who Should Buy: Intermediate and above archers.

When to Upgrade: Once you switch to custom arrows, there will be two instances in which you will need to upgrade. First, if you increase your draw weight, you may also need to get new arrows with a different spine. 
Second, if you advance to a level where your arrow needs to upgrade in order to match your skill. This could be upgrading the shaft to a better shaft, or changing the type of vanes. Vane changes are cheap(er) and 
can be done at home. Getting new shafts require fully new arrows.

<h2 id="where2buy">Where to Buy Arrows</h2>
<p>
It’s very important to know where you are going to buy your equipment from. 
You want to make sure they are reputable and that you are getting reliable, safe equipment.

Local Shop - We highly recommend that you purchase equipment through your local shop. Most archery shops will have aluminum "box arrows" for immediate purchase, as well as the option to purchase custom arrows. They will be able to walk
you through the process of selecting the correct arrows for your setup.

Lancaster Archery Supply - This is THE online place to buy archery supplies. However, buying arrows online is extremely difficult and hard to understand. This purchase is best made in person.

★ Note on Buying from Amazon - Amazon is NOT a reputable site to buy archery equipment from, ESPECIALLY ARROWS. Often the equipment found on Amazon is of low quality or is a toy kit not meant for real archery. We do not recommend buying your archery equipment from Amazon, and instead recommend the places above.
